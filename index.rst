The AgileX Robotics LIMO is a ROS development and learning platform that integrates four steering
modes and comes pre-installed with plenty of demos and examples. LIMO is a perfect platform for
robot education, research and development, and can serve as a model for industrial applications.
With its innovative mechanical design, LIMO can quickly switch its steering mode between four-wheel
differential, Ackermann, tracked, and Mecanum. The LIMO is equipped with an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, an
EAI XL2 LiDAR, an ORBBECÂ® Dabai stereo depth camera, and a suite of other sensors which can all be
used to perform advanced robotic applications like precise autonomous positioning, SLAM, path
planning and navigation, obstacle avoidance, traffic light recognition and so on.

What's Here
===========

*   :doc:`getting_started` - These guides will walk you through the setup process
    for your LIMO, the remote control mobile application, and your development environments.
*   :doc:`operation` - These guides will walk you through concepts related to the operation of the
    LIMO and the Simulation Table.
*   :doc:`demos` - The demos will help you understand some of the more advanced capabilities of the
    LIMO.
*   :doc:`specifications/specifications` - Contains specification information for the LIMO and the
    Simulation Table.
