=====================
Turning Off Your LIMO
=====================

1.  It is a good idea to cleanly turn off the LIMO's onboard computer when you are finished using it.
    To do this, type ``sudo poweroff`` in its terminal and enter the password ``agx``.

2.  Press and hold the LIMO battery's power button until the robot powers off.
