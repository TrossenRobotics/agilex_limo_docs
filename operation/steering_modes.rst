*   **Ackermann:** The Ackermann steering geometry is a geometric arrangement of linkages in the
    steering of a car or other vehicle designed to solve the problem of wheels on the inside and
    outside of a turn needing to trace out circles of different radii. `[Wikipedia]
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_steering_geometry>`_
*   **Four-wheel Differential:** A differential wheeled robot is a mobile robot whose movement is
    based on two separately driven wheels placed on either side of the robot body. It can thus
    change its direction by varying the relative rate of rotation of its wheels and hence does not
    require an additional steering motion. Robots with such a drive typically have one or more
    caster wheels to prevent the vehicle from tilting. `[Wikipedia]
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_wheeled_robot>`_
*   **Tracked:** Tank steering systems allow a tank, or other continuous track vehicle, to turn.
    Because the tracks cannot be angled relative to the hull (in any operational design), steering
    must be accomplished by speeding one track up, slowing the other down (or reversing it), or a
    combination of both. `[Wikipedia] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_steering_systems>`_
*   **Mecanum:** The mecanum wheel is an omnidirectional wheel design for a land-based vehicle to
    move in any direction. `[Wikipedia] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel>`_

Switching Steering Modes
========================

Switching to Ackermann
----------------------

Pull up the latches on both sides, turn 30 degrees clockwise to make the longer line on both
latches points to the front of the vehicle body, and then they will be stuck. When the vehicle
light turns solid green, the robot is in Ackermann steering mode.

Switching to Differential
-------------------------

Pull up the latches on both sides, turn 30 degrees clockwise to make the shorter line on the two
latches points to the front of the vehicle body. At this point, it is in insertion state. Fine-tune
the tire angle to align the hole so that the latch is inserted. When the vehicle light turns solid
yellow, the the robot is in Four-wheel Differential steering mode.

Switching to Tracked
--------------------

With the robot in four-wheel differential mode, the track can be put on directly. It is recommended
to put the track on the rear wheel with small space first.

.. warning::

    When using Tracked mode, please lift the doors on both sides to prevent scratches.

Switching to Mecanum
--------------------

First remove the hubcaps and tires, leaving only the hub motors. Then, ensuring that the small
roller of each Mecanum wheel is facing the center of the body, install the Mecanum wheel with the
included M3*5 screws.

.. note::

    When switching to the Mecanum steering mode, make sure that each Mecanum wheel is installed at
    the angle shown above in the third picture.
